What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
	gitignore file is a text file which let git know what files and folders need to be ignored in a project.
	when we are generating a Java project we need .gitignore to look like this
	
# Compiled class file

*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #

*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz

What does fast-forward in Git mean?
	fast-forward is used when we try to merge a branch which is ahead of the one we checked-out.
	For example if we are merging a branch1 with branch2 but branch2 has advanced by two commits. So fast-forward simply updates branch1 to refernce same commit that branch2 does.  


Why should you have different branches?
	Development team members isolate there work from others through branching out from main code base this helps them work faster. Then they can merge there code easily into the original code base.


In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
	We will have one remote Git repository, but we can add as many as we need.
